# Codeforces ICPC Assiut University Training Sheets.

**Assiut University Training for Newcomers.**

This repository contains solutions to the ICPC Assiut University Training Sheets, implemented in the C++ programming language.

## About the Problems
We encourage you to explore different solutions and experiment with various approaches to problem-solving. Remember, there is no single "correct" way to solve a problem, so feel free to try new methods and learn from any mistakes along the way.

## Accessing the Problem Sets
The training sheets are accessible through the following [Codeforces Group](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests). Each problem set is categorized by difficulty level and topic, enabling you to track your progress and focus on specific areas of interest.

## Overview
The training sheets cover a comprehensive range of fundamental programming topics, including:

- Basic Input and Output.
- Conditional Statements.
- Loops.
- Arrays and Strings.
- Functions.
- Recursion.
- Sorting and Searching.
- Data Structures.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of these problem sets are to:

- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Provide hands-on experience with algorithmic thinking.
- Strengthen your understanding of core programming concepts.
- Develop the ability to approach and solve algorithmic challenges.
- Prepare participants for competitive programming contests, such as the ICPC.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have a solution that is not currently included, please feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly valued and appreciated.

## Copyright
All problems and solutions provided in this repository are intended solely for educational purposes. They should not be used for commercial gain without the explicit permission of the original authors and contributors.
